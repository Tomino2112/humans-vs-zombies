Humans vs. Zombies
=====================

Inspired by tasks on Coderetreat in Beijing (wchich I unfortunately didn't attend) and my recent 
Java beginning study for university, I decided to write this small Java app.

App will walk you throught the whole proccess. First you need to input size of a grid,
then umber of humans and zombies and then you can wait and see who will survive!
